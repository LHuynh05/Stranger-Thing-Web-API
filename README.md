## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API

Stranger Thing project allows user to look up the information on their favorite characters.  The info is provided by using an API and displayed on the DOM.

## Optimizations


Currently, the site only provides 5 categorical information for the character and an image, I would like to add more information about the character as well as the actual person that plays the character to give the user more substance.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that each API has its own rules and methods for gathering data.  I had a hard time figuring retrieving the json from this API however, I learned to carefully read the documentation and you can find the correct route to getting the information that you need.
